# TurMessenger

TurMessenger is a Facebook Messenger desktop client powered by [Tauri](https://tauri.app) and Rust. **This is a fork of a Tauri based WhatsApp desktop app, and I am indebted to his skills**

TurMessenger is an experimental client and is initially created to test out Tauri itself. So, it might lack some features and might be buggy at times.


## Installing

It is currently distributed as only Debian and AppImage. Head to [Releases](https://github.com/erayerdin/taurapp/releases) page and pick the latest version and download the desired format. It also does not autoupdate yet, so you have to check out the releases page from time to time, redownload and reinstall again. Again, the project is highly experimental at this point.

## Features
